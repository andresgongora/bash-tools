#                                  Introduction
<!--------------------------------------+-------------------------------------->
My personal collection of bash utility scripts, meant to support a wide range of
applications; but not very useful by themselves.
You can find more details and similar tools on
[Yet Another Linux'n Electronics Blog](https://yalneb.blogspot.com/).


*DISCLAIMER*
Note that some script snippets might be from third parties.
I collected them over many years from forums, wikis, and chats.
The original authors, if known, are referenced within the individual scripts.
If you recognize a snippet and the file has no reference
(specially in the older ones), kindly let me know.
